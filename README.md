# Card Sarcophagus

This project is currently a work in progress

## About
This project has been created to help out Yu-Gi-Oh! players with their card collections. Every player has had to deal with the issue of "I think I own this card... or did I trade/sell it away??" or "I know I have this card but where?". Players have huge amounts of bulk that can be stored in either binder or boxes and when looking for a specific card they have to endlessly search until it has been found.

## How to use
Coming at a later date
